I hope you have the time of your life
Hope you're having fun in the prime of your life right now
Hope you get some sleep sometimes
Had yourself some kids and you found you a wife by now

I know I made it difficult
You'll pay for every promise I broke
One dream, so many different roads
You took yours and I took mine

Dear, my future self
I should've made it easy for ya
I could've got some help
It woulda been so nice to know ya
Say hello to everybody wherе you're at
And I'll blow all the kisses to thе people in the past
Dear, my future self
It woulda been so nice to know ya

Hope you take some time for yourself
Laugh with your friends and you check on your health someday
Hope you grab a beer with your mom
Call her now and then 'cause you know she'll be gone someday

I know I made it difficult
You'll pay for every promise I broke
One dream, so many different roads
You took yours and I took mine

Dear, my future self
I should've made it easy for ya
I could've got some help
It woulda been so nice to know ya
Say hello to everybody where you're at
And I'll blow all the kisses to the people in the past
Dear, my future self
It woulda been so nice to know ya
