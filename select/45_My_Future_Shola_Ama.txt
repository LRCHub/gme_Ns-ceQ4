Hey...
You are my love,
You are my life,
My future...

Seven years I lived for ya,
Cause I'm so in love with you...
Dedicate my life to ya.
I don't know where, I'd be,
If it wasn't for you.

Times I've straight from ya,
I'd lost my way,
But now I'm back with ya,
And you better belive,
I'm here, here to stay.

Now I know I'm blessed,
You are my happyness.
Everyday I know,
Because I feel you in my soul.

You are my love,
You are my life,
My future.

I know every day, every way,
Your light is guiding me.
I was lost, but than you came,
Thank you for finding me.
You gave me the change to share,
What's the side of me.

I'm sure that you're destend for me.
Like the brightest star that shines for all to see.
How could I be so blind, not to see,
You be all that I need.

Now I know I'm blessed,
You are my happyness.
Everyday I know,
Because I feel you in my soul.

You are my love,
You are my life,
My future.

Now I know I'm blessed,
You are my happyness.
Everyday I know,
Because I feel you in my soul.

You are my love,
You are my life,
My future.
